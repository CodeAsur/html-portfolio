<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Karthikeya Boddu. I am currently studying Computer Science Engineering in NIT Warangal,Telangana. Completed
  my schooling and intermediate in Hyderabad. Currently learning web development from Angela Yu's Udemy Course. This following
  is my portfolio website. I am still a beginner and have not meddled with the likes of css,java,etc.
</p>

<p>All the projects I have done are slight improvements over Angela's assignments. I try to stay regular in my learning and
  try to learn new things every day. I am also improving my skills in basic c++ coding for my college exams and assignments.
  I do hope learning these skills give me quite an edge over others and make myself replacable in the declining job market.

<p>Please do rate my work and try to input constructive feedback.
  Thank you.
